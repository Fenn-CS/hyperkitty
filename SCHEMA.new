Design for new archiver schema

 per message
  from message body (scalar unless noted)
   - subject
   - to
   - from
   - date
   - in-reply-to
   - message-id
   - references (list)

  generated
   - tags
   - categories (perhaps, these are special tags that the sysadmin configures in the .cfg)
   - likes/dislikes
   - thread-id
   - filename (for maildir, else it would be nice to have pointer offsets into a mbox)
   - type == 'mail'
