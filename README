# symlink them into the virtualenv similar to this:
yum install -y python-notmuch
# Note: on a multiarch system like Fedora, the directories may be lib64 rather
# than lib on 64 bit systems
cd lib/python2.7/site-packages

# Note: this is the version of notmuch I tested with; others may work

# put the sources there:
git clone http://ambre.pingoured.fr/cgit/hyperkitty.git/
